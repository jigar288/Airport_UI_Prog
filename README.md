# Airport_UI

***code is protected and can be provided for valid reasons***

A C++ Program that represents a airport travel network. Its basically a user interface that allows you check, create, and remove flights. 

Data Structues:

- adjacency list
- dynamic array

What I learned:

Depth-first search is excellent for checking reachibility in a graph. Unlike, breadth first search it doesn't find the shortest path in a graph.

Code for breadth first search to find the shortest path from one airport to another airport will be uploaded after Dec 5th
